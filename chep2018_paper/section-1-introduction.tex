The HEPiX IPv6 Working Group (ref) has been investigating the many issues involved in the deployment and use of
IPv6 in HEP in general and more specifically in WLCG. The group's papers at CHEP2016 (ref)
presented the status then of the work to allow sites to deploy IPv6-only CPU resources. Driven by the
requirements of the LHC experiments, the WLCG Management Board, in September 2016, had approved our plan
that all WLCG storage services should aim to support dual-stack IPv6/IPv4 by the end of 2018. Since then the
group has worked with the WLCG IPv6 task force to encourage, support and monitor that transition and to identify and help
solve any technical issues as they arise.

This paper is organised as follows.  Section 2 presents the current status of the transition for the Tier0/Tier1s, the Tier2s and the Experiment Services.
Section 3 presents an update on service availability and network monitoring and also reports on the fraction of FTS data transfers currently taking place over IPv6.
Finally section 4 contains future plans and conclusions.
