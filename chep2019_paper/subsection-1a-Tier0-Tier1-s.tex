The Tier-0 CERN is IPv6 and IPv4 dual-stack. The Tier-1 sites: CA-Triumf, DE-KIT, ES-PIC, FR-CCIN2P3, IT-INFN-CNAF, NDGF, NL-T1 (SARA-Matrix and NIKHEF), RRC-JINR-T1, TW-ASGC, UK-T1-RAL, US-T1-BNL, US-T1-FNAL are dual-stack deployed as shown in the following figure ~\ref{fig:t1ds}.

There is only one part of the russian tier-1 RRC-KI-T1 deployed with IPv4 only. The dual-stack perfsonar server is deployed at all sites except NL-T1-NIKHEF. The FTS server at FNAL is still running in IPv4 prefered mode but even this server will get deployed in dual-stack as soon as possible.
