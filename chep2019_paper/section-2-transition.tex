% Do we start with a few general words of introduction about the general aims and history of the transition to dual-stack storage?
% Together with reminders of the agreed timetable (and refer to old CHEP papers from our group)?

The long process of enabling the protocol IPv6 at LHC started already 10 years ago in 2010. Today, after extensive testing by the HEPiX IPv6 working group \cite{ipv6-chep15} and the strong support of the storage developer community, the current WLCG storage and grid-middleware applications now fully support the use of IPv4 and IPv6 protocols simultaneously; they are dual-stack ready or even protocol agnostic.
