%section{LHCOPN & LHCONE}


The LHCOPN and LHCONE are both virtual private networks (VPN) serving the Large Hadron Colider Experiments and both networks are from the end of 2016 anward dual-stack ready. LHCOPN is a CERN (Tier-0) centric star network mainley deployed for the distribuion of the raw detector data to the tier-1 sites. Since the majority of Tier-1 sites are dual-stack ready and even while the protocol IPv6 is prefered it is still not the situation that IPv6 is the only transfers protocol, but a tendence towards IPv6 fle transfers are recognizible.
