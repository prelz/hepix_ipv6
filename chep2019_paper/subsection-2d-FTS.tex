\subsection{WLCG data transfers}

For more than the last two years, since we started encouraging the Tier-2 transition, we have been regularly tracking the fraction of WLCG data transfers that take place over IPv6. We have been able to use the IPv6 protocol filter in the monitoring of the total WLCG FTS \cite{fts3} data transfers.
The fraction of WLCG FTS data transfers over IPv6 as a function of date is shown in  figure~\ref{fig:FTS}.

\par We have been aware of the fact that some data transfers between systems have been taking place over IPv4 even when both ends are dual-stack enabled. In the majority of cases this has turned out to be due to configuration settings which have either deliberately or accidently been set to prefer IPv4. We note that when transfers do take place over IPv6, they do so in such a way that the LHC experiments do not notice any difference in behaviour compared with transfers over IPv4.
