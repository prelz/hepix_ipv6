abstract="In the area of network monitoring a lot of tools are already available to measure a variety of metrics. However, these tools are often limited to a single administrative domain so that no established methodology for the monitoring of network connections spanning over multiple domains currently exists. In addition, these tools only monitor the network from a technical point of view without providing meaningful network performance indicators for different user groups. These indicators should be derived from the measured basic metrics.",

  abstract={This paper provides a detailed overview of the Unified Monitoring Architecture (UMA) that aims at merging the monitoring of the CERN IT data centres and the WLCG monitoring using common and widely-adopted open source technologies such as Flume, Elasticsearch, Hadoop, Spark, Kibana, Grafana and Zeppelin. It provides insights and details on the lessons learned, explaining the work performed in order to monitor the CERN IT data centres and the WLCG computing activities such as the job processing, data access and transfers, and the status of sites and services.}

  abstract={The File Transfer Service (FTS) is the service responsible for distributing the majority of LHC data across the WLCG infrastructure. We present the current status and features of the new File Transfer Service (FTS3), which addresses the problems that the previous FTS version faced : static channel model, configuration and scalability problems, new protocols support, more database back-ends support, etc. We present the solution we implemented and the design of the new tools as well the reliability, stability, scalability and performance requirements of a data movement middle-ware in the grid environment. The ultimate goal has been to deliver a service which scales horizontally, is easy to install and configure, supports protocols via a plug-in based mechanism (GFAL2) and can perform multi GB/s data transfer on the full mesh of its tiered centres.}
