\begin{abstract}
The HEPiX ({\tt http://www.hepix.org}) IPv6 Working Group has 
been investigating the many issues which feed into the decision on the 
timetable for the use of IPv6 networking protocols in HEP Computing, in 
particular in WLCG. RIPE NCC, the European Regional Internet Registry, ran 
out of IPv4 addresses in September 2012. The North and South America RIRs 
are expected to run out in 2014. In recent months it has become more clear 
that some WLCG sites, including CERN, are running short of IPv4 address space, 
now without the possibility of applying for more. This has increased the 
urgency for the switch-on of dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 on all outward facing WLCG 
services to allow for the eventual support of IPv6-only clients. The 
activities of the group include the analysis and testing of the readiness 
for IPv6 and the performance of many required components, including the 
applications, middleware, management and monitoring tools essential for 
HEP computing. Many WLCG Tier 1 and Tier 2 sites are participants in the 
group's distributed IPv6 testbed and the major LHC experiment collaborations 
are fully engaged in the testing. We have worked closely with similar 
activities elsewhere, such as EGI and EMI. We are constructing a group 
web/wiki which will contain useful information for sites on the IPv6 
readiness of the various software components. This includes advice on 
IPv6 configuration and deployment issues for sites 
({\tt http://hepix-ipv6.web.cern.ch/knowledge-base}). \\
This paper will describe the work done by the HEPiX IPv6 working group 
since CHEP2012. This will include detailed reports on the testing of 
various WLCG services on IPv6 including data management, data transfer, 
workload management and system/network monitoring. It will also present 
the up to date list of those applications and services which function 
correctly in a dual-stack environment together with those that still 
have open issues. The plan for more testing on the production infrastructure 
with a dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 setup and the work required before the support 
of IPv6-only clients is realised will be described.
